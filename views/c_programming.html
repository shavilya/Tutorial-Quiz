It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, a simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development.<br>Many later languages have borrowed syntax/features directly or indirectly from C language. Like syntax of Java, PHP, JavaScript, and many other languages are mainly based on C language. C++ is nearly a superset of C language (There are few programs that may compile in C, but not in C++).<br><br><b>Beginning with C programming:</b><br><ol><li>Structure of C language<br>After the above discussion, we can formally assess the structure of a C program. By structure, it is meant that any program can be written in this structure only. Writing a C program in any other structure will hence lead to a Compilation Error.</li><li>Writing first program code<br>Line 1: [ #include stdio.h ]<br>Line :2 [ int main(void) ]<br>Line 3: [ printf(“GeeksQuiz”); ]<br>Line 4 :[ return 0; ] </li><li>How to excecute the above program:<br>Inorder to execute the above program, we need to have a compiler to compile and run our programs.For Linux, gcc comes bundled with the linux,  Code Blocks can also be used with Linux.</li></ol> "

Basically, a variable used to store some form of data. Different types of variables require different amounts of memory, and have some specific set of operations which can be applied on them.<br><br><b>Variable Declaration:</b> <br><br>A typical variable declaration is of the form:<br>type variable_name;<br>or for multiple variables:<br>type variable1_name, variable2_name, variable3_name;"
